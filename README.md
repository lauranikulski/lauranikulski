### Hi, I'm Laura 📊

🏠 I am a webtoon marketer based in Seoul, Korea. 

🖥️ In my spare time, I enjoy coding in Python as a hobby and learning more about analytics in particular. 

🤝 As part of my learning journey, I am a club captain at Codecademy, where I host monthly meetups - video walkthroughs are hosted on the YouTube channel below and select code is shared via this GitHub profile.
